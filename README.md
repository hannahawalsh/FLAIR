FLAIR, which stands for Financial Literacy AI Resource, is our Hackathon submission for Finastra's Hack to the Future 4 (2022).

## Overview
FLAIR – Financial Literacy AI Resource – is a service that provides factual, trustworthy, and easy-to-understand answers to all your financial questions. FLAIR utilizes natural language processing and state of the art AI models to provide answers to financial literacy questions. Being trained only on resources provided by the US government, the answers are fact based and bias free to support sustainable and inclusive finance. 

FLAIR complies all the information you need into one easy-to-use search engine, without the pesky ads, opinion pieces, and conflicting answers that traditional search engines provide. It can be embedded in websites that are already providing resources to underserved populations, such as the formerly incarcerated, disabled, immigrant, and military communities.

## Inspiration
Involvement in the criminal justice system creates barriers that are far beyond the physical ones created when in prison, such as the massive hurdle of financial literacy and inclusion. A 2014 study by the UALR Institute on Race and Ethnicity found that incarcerated people were less likely to have ever had a checking account or credit card. They were also more than twice as likely to take out payday loans <sup>[1](https://ualr.edu/news/files/2014/06/FinalIREReport.pdf)</sup>. We were inspired to create a solution that helps formerly incarcerated people’s re-entry to society and help understand the financial world they must navigate when released. 

With further research, we found that there are many underbanked communities. Newcomers to the U.S. have a hard time navigating a new financial system. Disabled people have difficulty juggling their medical costs and government benefits. The elderly have new and often unexpected expenses as they age. The list goes on and on.

It takes a lot of time and research to find answers to all your financial questions; currently, there is no single resource that can help you. And how do you know the answer you find is trustworthy? Is someone just trying to sell you their product? Is that Yahoo answer a joke? The more you dig, the more confusing it becomes. So, we created FLAIR – the most comprehensive, trustworthy, and intuitive financial literacy resource. 

Let’s face it – finance is hard to understand for most of us, so a solution like this can support and equip so many different underbanked communities with the financial knowledge they desperately need.

## Personas & Functionality
Meet John – John was formerly incarcerated and is trying to get back on his feet. He has many questions as he re-enters society and to help answer them, he heads to online resources for support. Here John is on one of many sites that support successful reentry. As John learns more about the services offered, he sees FLAIR embedded on the site – John, like many formerly incarcerated people, lack financial knowledge – he didn’t grow up in a stable home and never learned much about finance. John asks FLAIR a question he’s been wondering for a long time: How do you build credit? Wow! Finally, an easy to understand answer – If John were to ask his standard search engine, he would get 4 advertisements and endless opinion pieces.

Meet Maria – Maria has recently immigrated to Ohio from South America. She has no family here and is navigating her new life in America. Maria heads to the internet to look for online resources and support. She’s able to access FLAIR and get answers easily to her financial questions.

From John to Maria, there are many other underserved communities, like the elderly, military and disabled communities that seek financial help and resources. FLAIR provides inclusive, sustained financial support where and when you need it most - Answers are fair when you’re asking FLAIR!

## What's Next
The first step to improve the application would be to gather more resources around financial literacy from the many government websites. We would parse these documents and add them to our financial literacy dataset. This data would be used to improve the NLP model, providing more accurate, readable answers on a broader set of topics. 

Additionally, we would like to tailor FLAIR for specific groups’ needs and embed it in more places. One example is connecting with sites that help formerly incarcerated people find jobs. These sources could point us toward relevant educational resources, laws, policies, and initiatives by the US government. By integrating this information into a targeted version of the model, FLAIR will be better able to answer questions on specialized topics, such as paychecks, taxes, and benefits. 

We would like to interview and continue learning about the various underserved communities, such as incarcerated/formerly incarcerated people, immigrants, etc. By learning about their biggest financial problems, we can improve FLAIR to be more knowledgeable and inclusive of their communities.
