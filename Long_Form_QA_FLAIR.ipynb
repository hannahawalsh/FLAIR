    "### The Long Form Question Answering Model\n",
    "A long form question answering model is an AI model that provides long, complex answers to questions. Unlike other question answering models, it does not simply pull snippets of text from a database for its answers, but synthesizes information to create one cohesive answer. It can answer more abstract questions rather than trivia-type ones.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Our model actually consists of two parts. One is the question-answer model, which pulls passages of text relating to the answer. The second is a sequence to sequence model, which forms those answers into one cohesive answer. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the functions used in this project are modified from the blogpost and accompanying github code [Explain _Anything_ Like I'm Five: A Model for Open Domain Long Form Question Answering](https://yjernite.github.io/lfqa.html), which goes more in depth on the technical aspects of this type of model. We applied their concepts to fit the needs of our project and apply it to the financial literacy world.  \n",
