      "A freeze helps prevent identity thieves from opening fraudulent accounts in your name. This also means you won't be able to apply for credit as easily if you were planning to open a new account or apply for a loan. You must contact each of the credit reporting companies to freeze your credit report. You will have to contact them to lift the freeze before a third-party can access your credit report. An initial fraud alert requires creditors to verify your identity before opening a new account, issuing an additional card, or increasing the credit limit on an existing account. This is a good first step if you're worried that your identity may be stolen, like after a data breach. The alert lasts for one year and can be renewed after it expires.\n"

You will pay interest if you carry a balance, and you can be charged other fees based on the terms of the contract. You can expect to make a minimum monthly payment and you may want to pay more than the minimum to pay it off sooner. Can use a credit card to pay bills over the phone or online. Easy to prove payment should a dispute arise. Protects you from having to pay for some or all the charges if your card or information is stolen or lost and you report the theft. Can be set up to automatically pay recurring bills. Can help build your credit history if you make payments on time and don't get close to your credit limit. Costs more than paying for the purchase with cash or a check if you can't pay the credit card balance in full every month. If you carry a balance, you have to pay interest on the balance.
