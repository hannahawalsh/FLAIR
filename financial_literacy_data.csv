At a glance This module can help you create a plan to fulfill your dreams by learning how to set, adjust, and reach your short-term and long-term goals. Revising your goals. Introduction Everyone has a different idea of the future they want to build. What do you want to accomplish in the near future? What do you want for yourself and your family in the long term? These ideas of your future are your hopes, wants, and dreams. But they don't just happen on their own. Accomplishing your dreams means thinking about the money you need to help make them come true.

Your values help shape how you prioritize what you do with your.  time, energy, and even money. If your goals support your values, you'll be more likely to prioritize them, which gives you a greater chance of accomplishing them. Setting goals along the way is a good strategy to help you achieve your dreams. Some goals may take a few weeks or months to reach, like saving money to buy gifts for the holidays or buying a new mattress. These are short-term goals. Others may take many months or even years to reach, like sending your child to college or paying off a large debt. These are long-term goals.

That makes it hard to build a plan to reach them. For example, most people say they want to make a better life for their children. But you have to think about the specifics of what ""a better life"" means for you, in order to build a plan to get there. That plan can be made up of one or many smaller goals. When you set goals, you can: Work toward making your future better; Prioritize how you spend your money so that it goes toward things that really matter to you Measure and track your progress toward getting the things you want out of life; Take pride in bettering your life and the life of your family."

It's even better to set SMART goals. Using the SMART goal method brings structure to your goal setting. This makes it much more likely that you'll be able to achieve your goals. All SMART goals have five characteristics: they are (S)pecific, (M)easurable, (A)chievable, (R)elevant, and (T)ime bound. Each part contributes to why this method is effective in goal setting. A specific goal has a much greater chance of being met than a general one because it provides something defined to reach for. For instance, it's much easier to plan a trip to Boston than it is to plan a trip ""to the east coast."""

Otherwise, it will be difficult to determine if you are going to achieve it. For instance, ""Save $5 a week"" is measurable. ""Save more money"" is not. You might want to get out of credit card debt tomorrow or become a millionaire within a year, but for most of us, those are unrealistic goals. That doesn't mean that your goals should be easy. Your goal may be a stretch for you, but it should not be extreme or impossible. If the goal feels like too much of a stretch, try breaking it down into smaller, more achievable goals."

This makes it more likely you will prioritize the time and effort it takes to achieve them. Goals should have a clearly defined time frame, including a target or deadline date. This helps ensure they are measurable and that steps are taken to reach the goal by the target date. Setting goals for life events and large purchases People often put off planning for large purchases or significant life events because they're struggling just to make ends meet today. Or don't think they have enough money to save.
7|YOUR MONEY, YOUR GOALS: A financial empowerment toolkit|cfpb_your-money-your-goals_financial-empowerment_toolkit.pdf|https://www.consumerfinance.gov/documents/8956/cfpb_your-money-your-goals_financial-empowerment_toolkit.pdf|MODULE 1: Setting Goals|But if you don't plan ahead for how you're going to meet these goals, you won't have the money to achieve them. This can add even more stress and uncertainty at times when a large purchase is necessary or life takes an unexpected turn. Planning in advance for large purchases not only helps you better achieve your goals, but helps remove anxiety around the purchase. Large purchases may include things like: Training or educational expenses; Tools or equipment you need for your job A car or home. There are also goals around things that happen in your life. Some of these life events are planned, while others happen without much warning. Creating goals around these events in advance helps you better achieve what you want and reduces stress when difficult life events do occur. Since many of these events happen later in life, it can give you more time to plan for them. This also means you can save smaller amounts over a longer period of time.

If you're being pressured to make a big-ticket purchase on-the-spot or salespeople are telling you conflicting things, that's a sign that something's not quite right with the deal.

When your goals match up with the values that are important to you and your family, you're more likely to prioritize achieving them. If you're not sure what your goals are, think about what you want to change in your life. See if there's a goal you can create that would help bring about that change. It's likely there are many things you want to achieve. But if you can focus on one or two priorities that align with your values, you'll have a better chance of reaching that goal. What to do; List your values to help you think about what is important to you and your family. Brainstorm a list of dreams and goals. Remember, dreams are aspirational and usually vague. Goals are specific things you can achieve to help you reach your dreams. Create a SMART goal from one or two items on your list of goals. Write down what makes this goal specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time bound.

One of the most effective ways to accomplish your goals is to create an action plan outlining the steps you'll take. Many goals also require external resources to achieve. These resources could include needing information, tools, transportation, or even a professional financial coach or counselor to help you. These kinds of resources should be added to your action plan. Research shows that people who write down specific goals are much more likely to reach their goals than if they don't write them down. Sharing those goals with a friend and checking in with them regularly about your progress also increases the chances that you'll reach your goals.

Planning for life events and large purchases Planning makes it easier to achieve long-term goals, like buying a car or having a wedding. This tool helps you think about what you want to achieve and how you can get there. Think about the life events you are likely to experience and the large purchases you might need to make. For most people, saving and starting early can make it easier. If you, like some people, end up borrowing money to make a big purchase, you can save in interest and fees if you have savings to cover some of the costs. You can also think about creative ways to save money.
19|YOUR MONEY, YOUR GOALS: A financial empowerment toolkit|cfpb_your-money-your-goals_financial-empowerment_toolkit.pdf|https://www.consumerfinance.gov/documents/8956/cfpb_your-money-your-goals_financial-empowerment_toolkit.pdf|MODULE 1: Setting Goals|What to do: Brainstorm a list of expenses using the categories at the top of the tool as a guide. Consider when you are likely to experience various life events (like a graduation party or having a child) or when you expect to make large purchases. Research and estimate the actual costs. Add in any associated expenses (like the interest you might pay on a car loan). If the life event or purchase is likely to happen more than five years from now, remember that the cost of almost everything increases over time, so add some extra money to the cost to cover this. Identify how much you might borrow versus how much you'll need to save. Many large purchases require a combination of borrowing and paying a portion up front. Identify ways to keep the costs as low as possible. For example, for a large party, you could save by asking family and friends to help you prepare food rather than hiring a catering company. You can also research when items are most likely to go on sale or ask for discounts. It may only be 5% or 10% off, but these can add up!

When your circumstances change due to life events (such as losing or getting a job, earning more money, having a child, having a health emergency, etc.), review your new situation with your goals. Ask yourself: Do these goals still match up to my current circumstances? Are these goals still attainable with this new circumstance? Could my circumstance help me reach these goals faster? Could my circumstance make me reach these goals more slowly?"

As circumstances change, your priorities may also shift. For example, if you lose your job, you might change your goal of saving for a nicer car to a goal of making sure that the car you have continues to run well. If it's a critical goal that can't be adjusted, you can look at adjusting other goals to ensure you. have enough money to fund the more critical one. If your circumstances change for the better and you have extra money to put toward a goal, like from a tax refund or an inheritance, think about putting some of the lump sum toward one of your savings goals. This can help you reach that goal faster.

One month into saving, you have some unexpected medical bills and can no longer afford to save as much each week. You can choose to buy a less expensive TV two months from now, meaning you need to save less money overall. Or you could choose to wait six months to buy the $600 TV, meaning you have longer to save.

And you can still save enough to buy the TV. If you've used your emergency savings, then they've served their purpose. But now it's time to replenish them. Ask yourself: Should I change how much I save each week for my emergency fund? Should I revise any other goals? Take action. Determine how much you want in your emergency savings and by when. Calculate the amount you need to save weekly or monthly to meet that goal and start saving. See Module 2: Saving for more information on this topic.

Think about where your priorities are and how you may be able to adjust the total amount or length of other saving goals. Sometimes circumstances change and a goal no longer feels important. And that's OK. If the goal you set before no longer feels right for you, set it aside and make a new goal that does feel right. Ask yourself: Does this goal still support my values? What's important to me now? Take action. Create a new goal that is important to you now. You can always add existing savings from the old goal to something new.

Saving|children's education, or retirement. Reasons to save Everyone has their own reasons to save, but there are common categories that most people think about when setting their savings goals. Everyone has unexpected expenses and emergenciesa car repair, the need to travel to help a sick family member, paying the bills when you've had a cutback in hours or even lost your job. When you save in advance for unexpected expenses and emergencies, you're better prepared to handle them without having to skip paying your other bills or borrowing money. If you have to skip paying other bills to pay for an emergency, there can be negative consequences like having to pay late fees or having services turned off. If services like your electricity or other utilities do get shut off, then you have to come up with even more money to turn them back on.
31|YOUR MONEY, YOUR GOALS: A financial empowerment toolkit|cfpb_your-money-your-goals_financial-empowerment_toolkit.pdf|https://www.consumerfinance.gov/documents/8956/cfpb_your-money-your-goals_financial-empowerment_toolkit.pdf|MODULE 2: .  Saving|If you borrow money for unexpected expenses, you will likely have to pay fees and interest on what you borrow. And on top of that, you'll probably have to use some of your future income to pay back the money you borrow. So saving money now for unexpected expenses and emergencies can save you money later. Consider starting an emergency fund with $500 as your goal. This is enough to cover a lot of common emergencies like a new tire for your car, a plane ticket to care for a sick family member, or minor medical costs. Once you reach $500, consider increasing your goal to $1,000. This may be enough to help cover your rent if you lose your job, take care of an insurance deductible for major car repairs, or pay for many household repairs.

Saving|Having this kind of emergency savings fund is the foundation for setting other savings goals. Once you have this set up, it's easier to focus on saving for other things without worrying about how you would handle an emergency expense. While the target amount for an emergency fund will vary from person to person based on their needs, $500 to $1, has been suggested as a starting point. See americasaves. org. Once you have some money set aside for unexpected expenses you can start planning for upcoming expenses and goals. Many people have goals they want to accomplish that require saving money. Some goals can take several months to achieve, like saving for a new TV. Others can take many years, like paying for a child's education. If you decide to save money for a goal, make sure the money you're saving is separate from your emergency fund. That way, if an unexpected expense comes up, using your emergency fund won't come at the cost of achieving your goal.

Saving|It's also important to save for periodic expenses (those that come only once or a few times a year) like renters insurance, income taxes, car insurance, or children's school supplies. While they're not unexpected, these expenses can be difficult to pay for all at once if you haven't been setting money aside for them. Saving money is particularly important if your income fluctuates or varies from week to week. This could be because your income changes depending on how many hours you are scheduled to work each week. It could also be because you work seasonally, rather than year-round. In both situations, setting aside money in weeks or months with higher income can help you pay your bills on time when your income decreases or stops.

Saving|Saving for college or technical training for you or your children may be one of your goals.

After you've made a decision to save you have to find the money to do it. There are only two ways to find money to save: spend less or earn more. You can decrease spending and put the money ""not spent"" into savings. In some cases, the easiest way to find money to save is to cut one major expense. This may mean dropping a service or membership you're paying for but don't use very often. Or it could mean cutting back on the level of service, like going from premium cable to basic."

Saving|"If there are no ""major costs"" you can cut, you may choose to cut back a little bit in several different categories of spending in order to save. For example, you might cut back on eating out and combine errands to spend less on gasoline. The savings from making small changes like this can add up. In addition to cutting expenses, there's also the challenge of where to actually store your savings so you aren't tempted to spend it. If you don't have a place to set savings aside, it can be easy to spend the money on something else. If you have cash, you could move the money you save into a savings jar or envelope in your home. Then in order to keep it secure as it grows, you could deposit the cash into."

Sometimes you experience an unexpected increase in income. For example, you may get unanticipated overtime, extra hours at work, a bonus, or a tax refund. Consider setting aside some of this ""extra"" income into your savings account. If you get paid bi-weekly, there are two months each year when you get three paychecks instead of two. You can take advantage of this ""extra"" paycheck to save for unexpected expenses later in the year. These are great opportunities to put some money away into your emergency savings fund.

Making savings automatic People who save successfully generally choose an automatic system of saving for their goals. They make the decision about where to save, set up the system, and then save money from every paycheck without having to think about it. If you have a bank account and direct deposit, you can arrange to automatically deposit some of your paycheck into a savings account every time you are paid. For example, if your weekly paycheck of $245 is directly deposited into your checking account, you can have $10 automatically deposited into a savings account. Once you set this system up, you may even ""forget"" about that $10 because you don't see it in your checking account. This can make it easier to adjust your spending to offset having $10 less per week. If you don't use the money in the savings account, you'll have over $500 by the end of the year."

Assets are things that you own. Assets can include money in a savings or checking account, and things like your car, home, land, and business inventory. Asset limits are rules about how much you can have or save before your benefits are reduced or taken away. Since assets help people achieve financial security, some assets won't count against allowable limits. Generally, the assets that may count against allowable limits are ""liquid,"" which means they are similar to cash. Some examples of liquid assets are money in a checking account, savings account, or investment accounts. While things like a home or car that you own are also considered assets, they're not liquid assets, so some program rules don't count them against the allowable limit."

Each program has different rules about what counts as an asset and the total value of your assets allowed to qualify for assistance. For some programs, these rules are the same regardless of where you live. For others, each state determines its own rules. In general, your liquid assets (like cash or money in savings or checking accounts) are counted as assets. In some states, if the value of your car exceeds a certain amount, anything over that amount may be counted as an asset as well.

Finding a place for savings Once you've decided to save you should decide where to keep your saved money. It's one thing to start saving money. It's another to figure out where to actually store that money for safekeeping. There are many places you could keep your savings, each offering specific risks and benefits. Some things to think about are how secure it is, whether there are costs associated with keeping it there, and how accessible it is. For example, keeping savings in a secret place in your home is easily accessible and is free, but may be less secure in the case of theft or a fire.

Money can also come from things like tax refunds, gifts, and inheritances, which can also be spent or saved like income.

Tracking Income and Benefits|Public benefits are payments you may receive from the government to help pay for necessities. Most benefit payments have restrictions about how they can be spent. So while these payments help increase your spending power, they aren't as flexible as income earned from a job. Income Income can be regular, coming into your household on a set schedule in an amount that you can count on. Or it can be irregular, where you can't accurately predict when you'll receive it or how much you'll receive. The ups and downs of irregular income can make it hard to be sure you'll have enough money to pay your bills and expenses, like food and transportation.

Tracking Income and Benefits|Sometimes income is seasonal, meaning you may receive it only some months during the year. For example, if you live in a state with cold weather and work in the construction industry, you may be very busy with work from March through November, but have no work at all from December through February. Finally, some income may be a one-time occurrence. Your tax refund is an example of a one-time source of income within a year. Managing income can be very challenging if it's irregular, seasonal, or one-time-only because you may not know how much money is coming in or when you'll receive it. Your bills and expenses, however, continue on schedule. Covering your expenses can be stressful if you don't know when your next paycheck will be or how much you'll be paid.

Tracking Income and Benefits|"If you're getting close to retirement age, you may be thinking about claiming Social Security retirement benefits to add to your income. Choosing when to begin collecting Social Security is an important financial decision. Once you've decided to start collecting, you can't change your mind. Social Security often becomes a primary source of income later in life, and that's when medical and health costs may be at their highest. Claiming as soon as you're first eligible can mean less money in total throughout your retirement. If you wait to claim Social Security retirement benefits until you're 70 (instead of when you become eligible at 62), your benefit increases by as much as 75 percent. The CFPB's ""Planning for Retirement"" tool at consumerfinance. gov/consumer-tools/retirement/before-you-claim can help you see how your Social Security payments will grow each year that you delay claiming.

Tracking Income and Benefits|Public benefits Public benefits are payments you may receive from local, state, tribal, or federal government agencies. They are often designed to help individuals and families that don't have the resources to cover their basic living expenses. You can get benefits only if you apply and qualify to receive them. For most benefits programs, eligibility is based on: Income Assets, like savings, a vehicle, or money in investments; Circumstances, like whether you have dependents or have a disability. Benefits are important financial resources that may cover some essential living expenses. That's why it's important to track benefits the same way you'd keep track of your income. But benefits aren't as flexible as income, because they usually can only be spent on specific things. For example, if you qualify for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), you can only use those benefits to purchase certain groceries. If you qualify for Medicaid, you can only use those benefits to cover qualified health expenses.

Some states require employers to offer paper checks, while others permit employers to mandate electronic pay for wages.

Tracking Income and Benefits|In some states, you might be offered unemployment benefits and other government benefits on a prepaid card. This means that instead of getting checks you receive a prepaid card, and each month the benefit amount is loaded onto the card. The federal government also allows you to have certain federal benefits, such as veterans' benefits or Social Security benefits, deposited in one of multiple ways. For example, benefits may be deposited to your checking or savings account, put on a federally insured prepaid card of your choosing, or loaded onto a prepaid card that the government arranges. The amount you can be charged in fees for using a government benefits card depends on the government agency and the financial institution issuing the card. Be sure to understand how and when fees can be charged and read the cardholder agreement carefully to understand the cheapest ways to access your benefits.

To better understand the pros and cons of each method, use the ""Choosing how to get paid"" tool. Protecting the money on your prepaid card On the back of a prepaid card, there's a phone number you can call in case something happens to your card. It's also usually in your cardholder agreement. Write down this phone number and your card number, and keep it somewhere safe. If your card is lost or stolen, be sure to call that number or log in to your account online to report it right away. If you can't find the number to report a loss or theft of a government benefits card, call the agency that provides your benefit. If someone else uses the card and your PIN number, there's a chance these benefits won't be replaced."

Tracking Income and Benefits|FICA and Medicare contributions are accurate as of February 2020. If a creditor sues you for unpaid debts and wins, they might collect the debt by garnishing your wages. This means that the creditor gets a court order and sends it to your employer, who must then take part of your paycheck and send it directly to the creditor. Garnishments can also come directly from your bank account. Your wages can also be withheld or garnished to pay back child support, defaulted federal student loans, back taxes, or other debts to a government agency, such as unpaid court costs. Garnishments continue until the debt is repaid or other arrangements are made to pay off the debt. The law protects certain types of income from garnishment, and also limits how much of your income can be taken.

The order should include contact information for the creditor and some information about the type of debt. Limits on wage garnishments. Generally, federal law limits wage garnishment so that you can take home enough income to live on, even if your wages are being garnished. Some state laws provide additional protections that allow you to keep more of your wages than the federal limits. Federal and state laws may protect the money you receive from certain sources from garnishment. This may include money you receive from a pension or retirement plan, federal student loans, child support, or spousal support payments. Other laws in your state may also protect a part of your money and assets.

Tracking Income and Benefits|To learn about these state law protections, you may want to consult a lawyer in your state. If the debt you owe to the government is for child support, there may be different rules.

The amount that can be taken from your wages may also be different. This kind of garnishment can be complicated too, so you may want to consult a lawyer. Limits to garnishment amounts. The amount that can be garnished from wages under federal law is usually limited to the smaller of these two amounts: percent of your disposable income; The difference between your weekly income and 30 times the federal minimum wage of $7. ($7.  30 = $217.50)

Tracking Income and Benefits|For the purposes of wage garnishment, your disposable income is what you earn after mandatory deductions, such as social security, federal, state, and local taxes, have been taken out of your pay. For example, if you earn $300 a week (after mandatory deductions), the limit on garnishments would be the smaller of these two amounts: percent of your disposable income. Weekly earnings $300. x 25% Total garnishment = $75. Difference between your income and times the federal minimum wage. Federal minimum wage $7. x 30. Subtotal = $217. Weekly earnings $300. $217.

Tracking Income and Benefits|Garnishments of a bank account. If someone you owe money to tries to garnish money from your bank account, your bank or credit union must check your account history for any Social Security or veterans' benefits directly deposited into your account within the last two months. The bank must protect two months' worth of benefits from garnishment and let you access that money, even if the bank freezes other funds. If your account has more than two months' worth of benefits, the bank may have to freeze the remainder of that money. If you receive Social Security or veterans' benefits by check and then deposit the check into your bank account, the bank doesn't have to automatically protect two months' worth of benefits in the account. This means that your entire account balance could be frozen. If this happens, you'll need to go to court to prove that the income comes from protected federal benefits and should not be garnished.

This simple rule may work for many people, but it isn't very helpful if you can't afford to pay all of your bills and living expenses.

And if your work is seasonal or irregular, you may be able to cover everything when you're working, but struggle to cover expenses in the months or weeks when you're not."

Paying Bills|Planning for bills The more you can prepare for the bills you know are coming, the better you can save for them. Having a plan and system in place for paying bills can make them easier to pay and help reduce stress. Before you can make a plan you have to first know how much income is coming in, how much spending is going out, and what bills are due when. It's impossible to know if you're going to be able to afford all your bills unless you're familiar with how much you're expected to pay each month. Make sure you know what bills are due, how much they usually are, and what time of the month they're due.
111|YOUR MONEY, YOUR GOALS: A financial empowerment toolkit|cfpb_your-money-your-goals_financial-empowerment_toolkit.pdf|https://www.consumerfinance.gov/documents/8956/cfpb_your-money-your-goals_financial-empowerment_toolkit.pdf|MODULE 4: .  Paying Bills|Tracking your spending is another good way to plan for bills. When you categorize and write down how you're spending your money, it makes it easier to know where you might be able to cut back. It also helps you think about how much of your spending is on needs versus wants. For example, before you make a purchase you can stop and ask yourself if it's something you need or want. You can also think about if making that purchase is going to make it harder for you to pay all your bills this month. Wants versus needs Separating needs, obligations, and wants can empower you to set priorities and understand more clearly where you can make changes if you decide your spending isn't matching your priorities.
112|YOUR MONEY, YOUR GOALS: A financial empowerment toolkit|cfpb_your-money-your-goals_financial-empowerment_toolkit.pdf|https://www.consumerfinance.gov/documents/8956/cfpb_your-money-your-goals_financial-empowerment_toolkit.pdf|MODULE 4: .  Paying Bills|Needs are the things you must have to live. These include shelter and utilities, food, medication, clothing, and transportation. Even with needs, deciding what you can afford, maintain, and are able to pay for can be a challenge. Obligations include debts you owe and payments you've been ordered to make, such as child support, spousal support, and other judgments. Wants are the things you would like to have but can survive without. For example, a reliable car to get to work is a need. A new car might be more of a want. But it's not always so clear-cut. One person may view something as a want, and another person may see it as a need.
113|YOUR MONEY, YOUR GOALS: A financial empowerment toolkit|cfpb_your-money-your-goals_financial-empowerment_toolkit.pdf|https://www.consumerfinance.gov/documents/8956/cfpb_your-money-your-goals_financial-empowerment_toolkit.pdf|MODULE 4: .  Paying Bills|Making paying bills easier If there's just not enough money to pay all your bills every month, you can try to cut expenses by making changes in your life. You might bring your lunch to work instead of buying at the cafeteria or use coupons when shopping at the grocery store. Even small changes can make a difference on being able to pay all your bills. Another thing you can do to make paying bills more manageable is look at when you have income coming in versus when bill payments are due. If you get paid at the end of the month but most of your bills are due at the beginning, it could make it hard to pay them on time. Many financial institutions will work with you to change the due date to make it easier for you to make those payments.
114|YOUR MONEY, YOUR GOALS: A financial empowerment toolkit|cfpb_your-money-your-goals_financial-empowerment_toolkit.pdf|https://www.consumerfinance.gov/documents/8956/cfpb_your-money-your-goals_financial-empowerment_toolkit.pdf|MODULE 4: .  Paying Bills|You can also think about what methods you want to use to pay your bills. Each method has its own advantages and disadvantages. It's important to understand what options are available, so you can decide what works best for you. Protecting your information on digital money apps It's becoming more popular to use mobile apps to keep track of your bills and other spending or a digital wallet to make payments. While they can be convenient, there are some things to keep in mind about protecting your money and information when using these types of digital tools. First, find out if there's a fee to use them. Some apps that appear to be free may have fees when you try to use them to send money or take a percentage of money that's sent to you.

Paying Bills|It's also important to safeguard your personal information. Some financial apps require you to enter the information that you want the app to use, like billing address or credit card information. Others pull information automatically from your financial accounts, but only after you give permission for the app to do that. Don't conduct financial transactions on public Wi-Fi. Password-protect your mobile device and any financial accounts you have access to. Don't save your passwords to financial accounts on your mobile device. Make your password longer and stronger to make your information more secure. Don't repeat passwords, don't save them in web browsers, and don't use common words or phrases that can be guessed. Use two-factor authentication to help protect your accounts. This is a two-step process in which you have to enter your password and then a code sent to you via text or email. Many banks and other financial service providers now offer this extra layer of protection. Take advantage of it.

Keeping track of what you earn and everything you spend money on for a month, rather than just a week or two, lets you see all of your income and expenses in one place.

Once you have these totals, add them together to get your total spending for the month. If tracking your spending for a whole month seems too difficult, try it for just one or two weeks.

For example, borrowing to further your education may be a good use of debt because earning a certification or degree could lead to a better paying job and more job security.

Dealing with Debt|Here are some examples of secured debt: A home mortgage loan is secured with the home you are buying. If you don't pay your loan, the lender can foreclose on your home, sell it, and use the money from the sale to cover some or all of your loan. In some states, the lender can ask you to pay the balance if the sale doesn't pay off the loan. An auto loan is secured with your car. If you don't pay your loan, the lender can repossess (repo) your car and sell it to cover some or all of the loan. In some states, they can also ask you to pay the balance if the sale doesn't pay off the loan. A pawn loan is secured with the item you have pawned. The lender physically holds the item during the loan. If you don't make the payment when it's due, the pawned item is eventually sold. An item purchased under a rent-to-own agreement, like a couch or television, must be returned or it will be picked up by the store if you don't make the payment. Debt from a secured credit card is secured by funds you deposit at a bank or credit union when you open the card. Your credit limit will generally equal your deposit. For example, if you deposit $300, your credit limit will be $300. If you don't pay back the credit card, the bank can pay itself from your deposit. You can use a secured credit card to build up your credit history. This can help you qualify for an unsecured credit card in the future.

Dealing with Debt|Unsecured debt doesn't have an asset attached to it. If you don't pay these loans, they often go directly to collections, since there are no assets associated with the loan to repossess. Examples of unsecured debt include: Credit card debt (most credit cards are unsecured) Department store charge card debt; Medical debt Student loans. Co-signers: Agree to repay the loan If you're considering co-signing a loan, you should first understand what you're agreeing to. A co-signer is a co-borrower and has the same obligation to pay a debt as the primary borrower. You owe the money that you co-sign for even if you don't receive any of it. Lenders sometimes ask for a co-signer when they are concerned that a prospective borrower won't be able to repay a loan. The co-signer helps decrease a lender's concern about repayment.
179|YOUR MONEY, YOUR GOALS: A financial empowerment toolkit|cfpb_your-money-your-goals_financial-empowerment_toolkit.pdf|https://www.consumerfinance.gov/documents/8956/cfpb_your-money-your-goals_financial-empowerment_toolkit.pdf|MODULE 6: .  Dealing with Debt|Co-signing a loan is not simply serving as a character reference for someone else. If you're the co-signer, you have to pay back the loan if the borrower doesn't pay it. In most cases a lender or creditor doesn't even have to first try to seek repayment of a debt from the borrower before seeking repayment from you as a co-signer. Your credit scores may also be affected if the borrower is late with or fails to make one or more payments. Co-signing a loan may also affect your ability to obtain a future loan because a creditor may take into account the increased amount of debt that you have as a result of co-signing for a loan.
180|YOUR MONEY, YOUR GOALS: A financial empowerment toolkit|cfpb_your-money-your-goals_financial-empowerment_toolkit.pdf|https://www.consumerfinance.gov/documents/8956/cfpb_your-money-your-goals_financial-empowerment_toolkit.pdf|MODULE 6: .  Dealing with Debt|If you decide to co-sign for a loan, you should read the terms of the loan and consider carefully before taking on the risk of co-signing. A joint account holder for a credit card has the same responsibility to pay as a co-signer on a loan. Any past due balances of the other joint account holder will also add to your debt and affect your credit scores. However, if someone is added to a credit card account as an authorized user, they aren't generally responsible for paying past due balances. But they are still able to use the credit card. Be careful when adding authorized users to your account, because they can create added debt that you will then have to pay.
181|YOUR MONEY, YOUR GOALS: A financial empowerment toolkit|cfpb_your-money-your-goals_financial-empowerment_toolkit.pdf|https://www.consumerfinance.gov/documents/8956/cfpb_your-money-your-goals_financial-empowerment_toolkit.pdf|MODULE 6: .  Dealing with Debt|Types of debt Different types of debt have different rules about borrowing and repayment. It's important to know these details so you can best prepare for how to better handle your debt. In this module, we will talk about: Student loan debt Medical debt; Payday loans Auto title loans; Rent-to-own arrangements. Student loan debt Many people take out student loans to help pay for their education. There are two general types of student loans: federal student loans and private student loans. Be sure to read your loan documents carefully to understand what kind of student loan you have and how long you have to repay it. With both federal and private student loans, late payments will affect your credit history and may result in collections.
182|YOUR MONEY, YOUR GOALS: A financial empowerment toolkit|cfpb_your-money-your-goals_financial-empowerment_toolkit.pdf|https://www.consumerfinance.gov/documents/8956/cfpb_your-money-your-goals_financial-empowerment_toolkit.pdf|MODULE 6: .  Dealing with Debt|These loans are made or guaranteed by the federal government. They usually have names like Direct Loan, Stafford, PLUS, or Perkins. Federal student loans usually offer more flexible repayment options than private student loans. The interest rate on federal student loans is set by the government and is fixed, which means it will stay the same for the length of the loan. Also, with certain types of federal student loans (called subsidized loans), the government will pay the interest on your loan while you're in school at least half-time. There are many options for repaying federal student loans to help make them more affordable to pay. Paying your loans on time and being in good standing are important to help you qualify for these repayment plans. So don't ignore student loan payment notifications. Missing payments on your federal student loans can hurt your ability to qualify for an alternative repayment plan that could lower your monthly payments.
183|YOUR MONEY, YOUR GOALS: A financial empowerment toolkit|cfpb_your-money-your-goals_financial-empowerment_toolkit.pdf|https://www.consumerfinance.gov/documents/8956/cfpb_your-money-your-goals_financial-empowerment_toolkit.pdf|MODULE 6: .  Dealing with Debt|You may not be eligible for an alternative repayment plan, based on the type of the loan you have and your financial circumstances. If you do apply for a different repayment option, it's important to continue making your loan payments under your current payment schedule until you receive written notification that you have been approved. This ensures your loan will continue to be in good standing. Finally, you may also apply for loan forgiveness, cancellation, or discharge. If your loan is forgiven, cancelled, or discharged, you are no longer expected to repay the loan. This can only happen in certain situations, including: Your school closes permanently or shuts down before you complete your program; Teacher loan forgiveness if you're a teacher working full-time in certain educational settings for five complete and consecutive academic years Public Service Loan Forgiveness (qualify while working in the public service sector, for a government agency or non-profit organization, making 120 loan payments on a Direct Loan under a qualifying repayment plan); Total and permanent disability Death (someone would apply on your behalf after death)

Dealing with Debt|"Except in these circumstances, it's very difficult to eliminate federal student loan debt, even in bankruptcy. If you're thinking about filing for bankruptcy, you may want to talk with a bankruptcy lawyer or legal aid organization. Private student loans are made by a lender such as a bank, credit union, state agency, or a school. They may have names like ""alternative"" or ""institutional"" loans. Most private student loans have variable interest rates, which means that your interest rate could increase or decrease over the life of the loan. Private student loans don't generally offer the flexible repayment terms or borrower protections featured in federal student loans. You might also need a co-signer to qualify for some private student loans."

Dealing with Debt|"Private student loan repayment options are generally more limited than federal student loans. If you're having difficulty paying back a private loan then it's important to communicate with your loan servicer. Private lenders may offer forbearance options that allow you to delay some payments on the loan. They may also offer alternative repayment plans, including plans where payments start low and gradually increase over the loan term (known as ""graduated payment plans""). Some private lenders may also modify loans based on a borrower's' financial circumstances, on a case-by-case basis. Finally, some lenders will cancel or forgive debt upon the death or disability of a borrower. To learn more about these options, contact your private student loan servicer."

Dealing with Debt|It's important to note that unpaid federal student loans can be collected in special ways, while private student loans are collected using regular debt collection practices. For instance, the Department of Education can garnish some federal benefits, such as Social Security and certain Veterans' Assistance benefits without a court order if you owe back-payments on your federal student loan. They can also take unpaid federal student loan debt payments out of your tax refund. If you're afraid that your federal benefits could be garnished to pay off missed payments on unpaid federal student loans, consider talking to a lawyer. For more information on wage garnishment, see Module 3: Tracking Income and Benefits.

Dealing with Debt|Debt collectors or private student loan collectors can't garnish your exempt federal benefits. On both federal and private student loans, a loan servicer or debt collector can report the bad debt to a credit reporting company and can sue you in court to try to collect the remaining debt. The CFPB has a section on its website dedicated entirely to helping you plan for ways to pay for education and training after high school.

Dealing with Debt|Medical debt For many people, a large portion of the money they owe is medical debt. Thirty-seven percent of working age adults in America reported having trouble paying medical bills or having medical debt in 2016. Medical debt has increasingly been a major factor in the decline of credit scores for some people. As of September 2017, the three major credit reporting companies Equifax, Experian, and TransUnionmust wait six months before they include past due medical debts on your credit reports.

Dealing with Debt|"Payday loans A payday loan or a ""cash advance"" is a short-term loan, generally for $500 or less. The lender might give you the money as cash, load the funds onto a prepaid card, or electronically deposit the money into your checking account. Payday loans are generally due on your next payday. You must either give the lender access to your checking account by electronic debit or write a post-dated check for the full balance in advance, so the lender can deposit your check when the loan comes due. Lenders sometimes require a borrower to provide a paystub or benefits receipt or provide the amount of their income."

Dealing with Debt|"Depending on state law and individual lender practices, other loan features can vary. For example, payday loans are often structured to be paid off in one lump-sum payment, but interest-only payments (""renewals"" or ""rollovers"") are possible in some states. In some cases, payday loans may be structured so that they're repayable in payments over a longer period of time, called ""payday installment loans."" The cost of the loan may range from $10 to $30 or more for every $100 you borrow. So a typical two-week payday loan with a $15 fee per $100 borrowed equals an annual percentage rate (APR) of almost 400 percent."

Dealing with Debt|You may also have to pay additional fees to your bank or credit union if there isn't enough money to cover the loan payment when the payday lender tries to take the. See consumerfinance. gov/askcfpb/1589. money you owe out of your account or cash the postdated check. This is on top of fees you're already paying the lender. State laws and other factors can influence how much you can borrow and the fees you're charged. Some state laws restrict or prohibit payday lending. HOW DO PAYDAY LOANS WORK? Here is an example of how a 14-day payday loan may work.  Note: 14 days is used for example purposes only. Repayment may fall on the next payday or another period as specified by state law or loan agreement.
193|YOUR MONEY, YOUR GOALS: A financial empowerment toolkit|cfpb_your-money-your-goals_financial-empowerment_toolkit.pdf|https://www.consumerfinance.gov/documents/8956/cfpb_your-money-your-goals_financial-empowerment_toolkit.pdf|MODULE 6: .  Dealing with Debt|A borrower visits a storefront payday lender or an online payday lender website and completes an application. There's generally no traditional credit check. Usually the borrower only needs a bank or credit union account. The borrower writes a post-dated check or provides electronic access to the account. The borrower gets the loan (the average loan amount is $350) and pays $10-$30 per $100 borrowed ($15 per $100 is the average fee for storefront payday loans; fees for online payday loans may be higher). The borrower provides the lender with a 14-day post-dated check for the amount of the loan plus the fee ($350 + $52. = $402.50). The lender may also seek the borrower's authorization to take the money out of their bank or credit union account.
194|YOUR MONEY, YOUR GOALS: A financial empowerment toolkit|cfpb_your-money-your-goals_financial-empowerment_toolkit.pdf|https://www.consumerfinance.gov/documents/8956/cfpb_your-money-your-goals_financial-empowerment_toolkit.pdf|MODULE 6: .  Dealing with Debt|"In 14 days, the loan is due. If the borrower does not have $402. to make the payment, he could renew or rollover the loan. Then he will pay the $52. fee again. Every 14 days, the borrower must pay the full amount or renew the debt by paying another fee of $52.50. The average borrower takes out five loans in a row before repaying the full original loan amount (and not borrowing again shortly thereafter). In this loan example, that would mean the borrower will have paid a total fee of $262. to borrow the original $350. Auto title loans An auto title or ""vehicle title"" loan is another type of short-term loan. You're typically required to own your car free and clear (without an auto loan or lease) and must give the lender your car title in order to borrow money. If you're unable to repay the loan, the lender can seize or repossess your car and sell it if you don't repay the loan, even if your car is worth more than the loan amount."
195|YOUR MONEY, YOUR GOALS: A financial empowerment toolkit|cfpb_your-money-your-goals_financial-empowerment_toolkit.pdf|https://www.consumerfinance.gov/documents/8956/cfpb_your-money-your-goals_financial-empowerment_toolkit.pdf|MODULE 6: .  Dealing with Debt|Auto title loans are often for amounts that are equal to 25 to 50 percent of the car's total value. A typical auto title loan is about $700. These types of loans tend to have an annual percentage rate of about 300 percent for a 30-day single payment loan. Auto title loans can be repaid in a single payment or in regular installment payments. If the state you live in permits these loans, you may be able to choose between repayment options or you may be limited to just one or the other. The majority of borrowers (about 80 percent) aren't able to repay a single payment auto title loan without re-borrowing. More than half of auto title borrowers take out more than three consecutive loans before they can repay the original amount.
196|YOUR MONEY, YOUR GOALS: A financial empowerment toolkit|cfpb_your-money-your-goals_financial-empowerment_toolkit.pdf|https://www.consumerfinance.gov/documents/8956/cfpb_your-money-your-goals_financial-empowerment_toolkit.pdf|MODULE 6: .  Dealing with Debt|If you can't repay the loan in full either in a single payment or after taking out repeated loans, your car can be repossessed. If that happens, state laws determine what repossession fees may be added and how long you have to pay off the balance due in order to get your car back. If your car is repossessed and you can't afford to pay back your loan plus the repossession fees, your car may be sold at auction. In some states, if the sale price of the car doesn't cover what you owe, you may still have to pay the difference.

Dealing with Debt|Rent-to-own arrangements Some people use a rent-to-own arrangement to get consumer goods, like furniture, electronics, and appliances. This is where you rent the items and typically have the option to purchase the items in one of two ways: by continuing to make payments for a specific period of time or by paying off the balance during the term of the contract. Items rented or purchased this way tend to be more expensive in the end than if you'd bought them outright. If you miss a payment the rent-to-own company can take the item back. You also have the option to return the item at any time. If you return the item or the rent-to-own company takes it back, you don't get a refund of any money that you already paid.

Dealing with Debt|Avoiding problems with debt Sometimes people don't have the money to repay a loan and the finance charges when they are due. This can happen with short-term loans that have to be paid back in just one or a couple of payments. In this situation, some people take out another loan to pay off the first one. It can be difficult to escape the cycle of borrowing to cover the loan payment and still be able to pay for other expenses like food, rent, and transportation. If you're considering a short-term loan product to meet an immediate need, it's important to think about how you'll pay off the loan before you borrow.

Dealing with Debt|The kinds of loans that often lead to frequent re-borrowing have many things in common: Small dollar loans, generally under $500 Must be repaid quickly (14 days is a typical payday loan term, for example); Require you to provide your bank account information to your lender, so that. the lender can automatically take payments from your account. If you don't have sufficient funds in your account at the time of the automatic payment, you may have to pay fees to your bank or credit union for non-sufficient funds in the account. Make sure you know how you'll repay your loan and how much the loan could ultimately cost you before agreeing to use any form of credit. If you find that you can't make your loan payment and cover your other expenses without taking out a new loan, ask the provider for a repayment plan that gives you more time to pay off the loan. Some lenders may not offer you any options.

Dealing with Debt|"If you're short on cash, consider some alternatives to borrowing small amounts of money for a short period of time. Negotiate for more time to pay if the loan is to pay a bill that's due. Think about what you're borrowing the money for. Is it a need, an obligation, or a want? If it's a want, consider whether it's possible to spend less money for it, not purchase it, or wait until you have the money for it. Use a credit card if you have one that is not maxed out while it will increase your monthly card payment, it could be cheaper in the long run depending on interest rates and fees. Use lower-cost short-term loan alternatives from a credit union or bank. If you don't qualify for this type of loan, consider using the ""Getting and keeping a good credit history"" tool in Module 7. Use your own emergency savings. See the ""Savings plan"" tool in Module 2 for tips on how to build an emergency savings fund. Discuss the situation with a credit counselor or financial coach.

The total cost of a payday loan depends on how long it takes you to save up to pay back the entire loan. In the example above, if you renew or roll over this loan four times, you would be in debt for a total of 10 weeks and could pay up to $262. in fees plus the $350 you borrowed, for a total of $612.50.

Debt settlement companies say they can renegotiate, settle, or in some way change the terms of your unsecured debt to a creditor or a debt collector.

Dealing with Debt|Debt log Before you can make a plan for paying your debt, you first have to know what you owe. A debt is money you owe. For things like rent-to-own arrangements, credit cards, payday loans, student loans, and mortgages, the total amount you borrowed is your debt. So your total monthly payment (including interest or fees) is part of your debt payment. There are other kinds of debt besides loans. For instance, your monthly electric bill isn't a debt, but if you're past due on your bill, that amount and any fees become debt. That past due amount should be counted in this tool as part of your monthly debt.

Dealing with Debt|In deferment, payment of both the principal loan amount and interest is delayed. If you have a subsidized federal loan, the government pays your interest during the deferment. If you have an unsubsidized loan, you must pay the accruing interest during the deferment or it will build up. When interest builds up on deferred student loans and isn't paid, it can be capitalized, which means it becomes part of the original principal loan amount that you owe. This means you will end up paying interest on the interest and ultimately owing even more. Deferments are only granted for specific circumstances including: At least half-time enrollment in college, trade school, a graduate fellowship, or a rehabilitation program for individuals with disabilities Unemployment; Certain periods of military service Times of economic hardship; Peace Corps service.

Dealing with Debt|Forbearance means that you stop paying your loan or pay a lesser amount on your loan for up to months. Like deferment, interest continues to build up during forbearance, even on subsidized federal loans. So if you don't pay the interest part during forbearance, it will be added to the loan principal and you'll pay interest on the interest. Your loan servicer determines whether you qualify for forbearance. It can be granted if you're temporarily unable to make your loan payments because of: Financial difficulties; Medical expenses Change in employment or loss of job; Other reasons set by your loan servicer.

You can have credit available to use without having debt. For example, you may have a credit card that is paid offmeaning you have credit available to use but don't owe any debt."

Credit reporting companies gather information from your credit history into a credit report. A credit report may show some of your bill payment history, along with some public record information and a record of how often you have applied for credit.

Understanding Credit Reports and Scores|As a result, you have more than one credit score. Banks, credit card companies, and lenders may use different credit scores to make decisions about offering you credit. HOW ARE CREDIT SCORES CALCUL ATED? Scoring companies have different mathematical formulas to calculate credit scores, all typically starting with the information from your credit report. Two of the most commonly used credit scores are FICO (calculated using formulas from Fair Isaac Corporation) and VantageScore (calculated using formulas from VantageScore Solutions). Each of these companies produces multiple versions of their scores for different purposes. These scores usually range from 300 to 850. A FICO score above 700 is considered good by most businesses, and scores of 750 and higher are considered the best.

Payment history tracks whether you're paying your bills on time. This is the biggest factor in your FICO scores. Paying bills late, not paying bills at all, and having bills that go to collections will likely cause your scores to drop. Paying your bills on time may help increase your scores. Amounts owed tracks what you owe, including debts that you are paying down over time. It also includes your credit utilization rate, which is how much of your available credit you're using. When the credit that's available to you decreases because you've used a portion of it and now owe money, your scores may drop.

A long credit history provides strong evidence of how you use credit and patterns of your payment behavior. Pie chart values are from FICO. See myfico. com. New credit is tracked by measuring credit inquiries about you made by creditors and others. If there are too many inquiries, it may signal that you have a high demand for credit. Because this may be an indicator of risk, your scores may drop. Your scores are not affected at all when you check your credit reports yourself.

For example, your FICO scores may increase if you have both revolving credit (such as credit cards) and other types of credit, such as a mortgage or an auto loan that you repay in installments, in good standing. Generally, it's considered a good thing to have a mix of credit, such as a mortgage, an auto loan, and not too many credit cards.

For example, if your total available credit is $10,000, you should have a balance of $3, or less.

If you set a goal of lowering your credit utilization rate to 25 percent or less, your credit card balance should be no more than $1,250, or $5, (the credit limit) multiplied by. (25 percent). You don't know when a credit card company will report your balance to credit reporting companies. If at any time during the month your credit utilization rate is higher than the rate the scoring model thinks is appropriate, you run the risk of lowering your credit scores. This means that the amount you have charged on a credit card can affect your credit scores even if you pay that amount down at the end of the month.

If you close some of your credit card accounts and put most or all of the balances onto a single card, your total credit limit may be lower than before. If doing this means that you're using a higher percentage of your total limit than you were before, it may hurt your credit scores because it's increasing your credit utilization.

For example, involuntary closures stay on your ChexSystems report for five years and on your Early Warning report for seven.

Choosing  Financial Products and Services|Some banks and credit unions require you to pay these old charges and fees before you're allowed to open a new checking or savings account, even if those fees are from another institution. Many banks and credit unions offer checking accounts and prepaid cards that are designed to reduce risks, for both you and the financial institution, by preventing overdrafts and overdraft fees. Because these products are considered less risky, many banks and credit unions may choose to rely less on banking history reports when deciding whether to offer you an account. You may be able to qualify for one of these products even if you were denied for another product recently.

Choosing  Financial Products and Services|"Before you open a bank or credit union account, ask to get a copy of the terms and fees related to that account. Review that carefully to understand any minimum balance requirement and how much you could be charged in fees. Each bank and credit union has its own rules and fees, so it's a good idea to shop around first.  Use the ""Comparing financial service providers"" tool to help you get a clear picture of what you're being offered. Some common fees to learn about are monthly maintenance fees, non-sufficient funds (NSF) fees, and overdraft fees. Find out what a bank or credit union charges for these before opening an account."

Choosing  Financial Products and Services|Banks and credit unions often offer several types of overdraft services. These services usually have fees associated with them. An overdraft occurs when you don't have enough money in your account to cover a transaction, but the bank pays the transaction anyway. You can overdraw your account through checks, ATM transactions, debit card purchases, automatic bill payments, or electronic or in-person withdrawals. If you overdraw your account, you have to pay back those funds. There are generally two types of services related to overdrafts. The first (sometimes called overdraft protection) is when you and your bank or credit union arrange for any overdrafts to be paid from money in your linked savings account. You pay a fee when the money available in your savings account is used to pay an overdraft in your checking account. The savings account often needs to be at that same bank or credit union. You can check if your bank offers this kind of overdraft protection and how much it costs.
339|YOUR MONEY, YOUR GOALS: A financial empowerment toolkit|cfpb_your-money-your-goals_financial-empowerment_toolkit.pdf|https://www.consumerfinance.gov/documents/8956/cfpb_your-money-your-goals_financial-empowerment_toolkit.pdf|MODULE 8: .  Choosing  Financial Products and Services|The second type of overdraft service is when a bank or credit union allows you to spend more money than you have in your checking account, but at a cost for each transaction. For debit cards and ATM transactions, you have to opt in to this overdraft service. If you opt in, the bank may allow you to withdraw more money from an ATM or spend more with your debit card than what you have in your account. This results in overdraft fees for each transaction you make without enough money in your account, which can happen several times in one day. These fees vary across banks, but are commonly $30-$35 for each transaction. Some banks and credit unions charge you a separate fee every day that your account stays overdrawn.
340|YOUR MONEY, YOUR GOALS: A financial empowerment toolkit|cfpb_your-money-your-goals_financial-empowerment_toolkit.pdf|https://www.consumerfinance.gov/documents/8956/cfpb_your-money-your-goals_financial-empowerment_toolkit.pdf|MODULE 8: .  Choosing  Financial Products and Services|If you don't opt in, your bank or credit union will generally decline your card (without charging a fee) if you attempt to withdraw cash or make a purchase that costs more than what you have in your account. The opt in service applies only to one-time debit card and ATM transactions. It doesn't affect overdrafts caused by checks or online bill payments. So even if you don't opt in, you can still be charged an overdraft fee in certain circumstances. For example, if a recurring payment you've set up with your debit card number or via a direct billing arrangement overdraws your account, you can be charged a fee. You can also still be charged overdraft fees for checks or other payments that exceed your balance.

Choosing  Financial Products and Services|If you've already opted in, you can change your mind and opt out at any time. Some banks use different names for their overdraft products. Ask questions and be sure you know what you're signing up for. Using a prepaid card A prepaid card is a card that you use to access money that's loaded onto the card in advance. There are different types of prepaid cards, but you can use most prepaid cards to make purchases, withdraw cash from an ATM, or get cash back at a store if the store's policy allows for cash back. You may also choose to have your wages directly deposited onto a prepaid card.

Choosing  Financial Products and Services|"There are different types of prepaid cards, with different features, functions, and fees. An open-loop prepaid card has a network logo on it, like Visa, MasterCard, American Express, or Discover. These cards can be used at any location that accepts that brand. It might be reloadable (see below) or it might be like a gift card, meant to be used until the balance is spent and then thrown away. A closed-loop prepaid card can be used only at certain locations. For example, it might be a gift card that's good only at a specific store or group of stores or it might be for use on your public transportation system. Most closed-loop cards don't have a network logo on them. A reloadable prepaid card can have money added to it multiple times. One common type of open-loop, reloadable prepaid card is called a General Purpose Reloadable Card, or GPR Card. Some cards start out as non-reloadable, but can become reloadable once you complete a registration process. Always register the card as soon as possible if you are offered the choice to do so. A payroll card is provided by your employer and your paycheck is loaded onto it. A government benefit card is a prearranged prepaid card used by a government agency to load your benefits. An electronic benefits transfer (EBT) card is a certain type of government benefits card used for needs-based programs such as Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), and other programs. Some college ID cards are also prepaid cards. Some colleges offer a ""closed-loop"" card, which you can use to pay only for things on campus. Other schools offer an ""open-loop"" card, which you can use at any retail location that accepts that network brand."

Choosing  Financial Products and Services|Read the information about the card carefully to understand all of the fees. Not every card charges each type of fee. Some cards charge a monthly fee but not per-transaction fees. Other cards may skip the monthly fee, but charge you transaction fees each time you use the card. You might be better off under a single monthly fee or with per-transaction fees, depending on how you plan to use the card. Make sure to check for any details on the card packaging. You can also usually look up information about prepaid cards, including full fee information, online before making your choice. Consider how you plan to use the card and look for one that makes the most sense for your needs.

You can call customer service (the number is usually on the back of your card) to check your balance. If you get your balance through the automated phone system, you usually won't be charged a fee. You can also talk to a live customer service agent, but some prepaid card providers will charge you a fee for that.

Check with your carrier to see if they charge a fee for these texts. Some prepaid cards allow you to check your balance at an ATM, but you may have to pay a fee for this service. If receiving paper statements is important to you, check the cardholder agreement  or the prepaid card provider's website to see if they offer paper statements.

A bank account debit card is linked to your checking account, so the money you spend with the card is taken directly out of your checking account. With a prepaid card, you are spending money that was loaded onto the card in advance. In most cases, you can't spend more money than what you've already loaded onto your prepaid card. Overspending can occur with a debit card if you've ""opted in"" to your bank's overdraft program. This means that your bank may cover a debit card purchase or ATM withdrawal that's more than what you have in your account and may charge you a fee for doing so. Your bank will require you to repay the overdraft and any related fees."

This can be confusing because both types of cards may have a card network logo on them, like Visa, MasterCard, American Express, or Discover.

Dealing with Debt|Debt can be hard to face when it feels like a barrier to your goals, but it's important to remember that there are resources you can use to help you take control of your debt. Even small steps toward paying down debt can make a big difference in making it feel more manageable. Focus on military communities When you don't pay debt, there are consequences. They can include: Late fees; increase in interest rates; Lawsuits Garnishment of wages or accounts; Loss of housing, services (utility or phone), or your vehicle Negative information on credit reports. For servicemembers, not paying debt, bankruptcy, or even too much debt can lead to: Loss of security clearance Loss of promotion opportunities; Involuntary discharge from the military.

Dealing with Debt|Too much debt is having debt you cannot regularly and sustainably pay. This amount is going to be different for everyone depending on income, other financial obligations, and the number of dependents. Too much debt relative to income can create vulnerability. For example, someone with a security clearance may be more susceptible to blackmail if they are struggling financially due to debt. Filing for bankruptcy, liens, foreclosures, wage garnishments, collections, repossessions, and loan defaults can lead to suspension of a security clearance and in some cases involuntary discharge from the military. To address this risk, the Department of Defense conducts automatic reviews of servicemembers' credit reports to help spot financial vulnerabilities including large debt loads. Getting a handle on debt to make regular payments and reduce debt balances is therefore an important part of being financially ready.

Dealing with Debt|SERVICEMEMBERS CIVIL RELIEF ACT (SCRA) The SCRA caps interest rate charges including late and other transaction fees to six percent (6%). The SCRA covers existing debts when a servicemember is on active duty. In other words, it only applies to debt incurred before active duty begins. The SCRA applies to: Student loans; Credit cards Car loans; Mortgage loans Medical bills; Installment loans Title loans. Joint loans qualify if the active duty servicemember is one of the owners and the loan was incurred before entering active duty. During active duty, any interest charged over and above 6 percent must be forgiven. For mortgage loans, the interest rate can be reduced for the duration the servicemember is in the military plus one year.

To be eligible for the interest-rate reduction of the SCRA you must: Notify each lender for which you have a legal obligation to pay. -Some lenders have an online application process for SCRA benefits. If they don't, make the request in writing. Know your rights. -Lenders may not change the terms of the loan. For example, they cannot accelerate the payment schedule when adjustment. -Lenders also cannot add the amount of interest above 6 percent back into the loan later after you leave active duty. In addition to the SCRA interest-rate reduction, there are other protections for servicemembers: Servicemembers sued while on active duty have some protections from a default judgment in a civil action. A default judgment is a court order in favor of the party or ""plaintiff"" suing the servicemember when he/she does not appear in court or defend herself against the lawsuit."

This protection applies while on active duty and for an additional one year after leaving active duty. This protection also applies in states that do not require a court order to foreclose and whether the lender or servicer was informed about servicemember prohibits creditors from repossessing servicemembers' personal property, including vehicles, without a court order. That means that even if the servicemember violates a contract by, for example, failing to make monthly payments, the creditor must first file a lawsuit and get an order from a judge before the vehicle or personal property can be repossessed. Servicemembers have the right to terminate residential leases of property that is occupied or intended to be occupied by the servicemember and his or her dependents. In addition to this right for residential leases, under certain circumstances, the SCRA also allows servicemembers to cancel or terminate an auto lease without paying early termination charges or penalties. Servicemembers and their dependents cannot be evicted from their primary residence without a court order. Even with a court order, the eviction could be delayed for days.

Understanding Credit Reports and Scores|Credit reporting companies gather information from your credit history into a credit report. A credit report may show some of your bill payment history, along with some public record information and a record of how often you have applied for credit. A credit report may also show how much available credit you have, how much of your available credit you're using, whether you have made your payments on time, and whether debt collectors have reported that they're attempting to collect debt that you owe. The information in your credit report is used to create credit scores. Many lenders use credit scores to decide how much money they are willing to lend you and how much interest to charge. In general, the higher your credit score, the better the loan terms may be.

This means that DoD can conduct an automated review of servicemembers' credit files to see if there is a history of failing to meet financial obligations, being in excessive debt, or having a high debt-to-income ratio. How does this information get on your credit reports? Banks, credit unions, retail credit card issuers, auto lenders, mortgage lenders, debt collectors, and others voluntarily send information to credit reporting companies, which can include: When you apply for an account When an account is opened; The amount loaned or the credit limit The account balances; The status of your payments If your account is in collection.

Setting goals along the way is a good strategy to help you achieve your dreams. Some goals may take a few weeks or months to reach, like saving money to buy gifts for the holidays or buying a new mattress. These are short-term goals. Others may take many months or even years to reach, like paying off a large debt. These are long-term goals.

Saving|To pay for their own goals, like a new TV, appliances, assistive devices, a car, a home, or retirement. Focus on people with disabilities Changes in the law and the emergence of new programs provide opportunities for people with disabilities to start saving and building assets to cover their basic living expenses, all while keeping their benefits. Programs and resources for building assets that are designed for people with disabilities include: Achieving a Better Life Experience (ABLE) Accounts, and the Plan to Achieve Self-Support (PASS) for people who are already receiving or have applied for Supplemental Security Income (SSI) and want to plan to become self-sufficient and save for a work-related goal.
654|Your Money, Your Goals Focus on People with Disabilities|cfpb_ymyg_focus-on-people-with-disabilities.pdf|https://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/documents/cfpb_ymyg_focus-on-people-with-disabilities.pdf|MODULE 2: .  Saving|Building savings while receiving public benefits Benefits payments often come with restrictions that limit options for making money and saving. If a person decides to make changes in their life and finances, they must follow complex rules to keep essential benefits. The people you serve may avoid saving for fear of losing their public benefits. Because savings are an asset, the relationship between asset limits and public benefits is addressed within this module. There are savings options for individuals with disabilities that do not impact the asset limits associated with SSI, Medicaid, or other benefits. Here we will review the following options: ABLE Accounts Plan to Achieve Self-Support (PASS); Special needs trusts and pooled trusts.
655|Your Money, Your Goals Focus on People with Disabilities|cfpb_ymyg_focus-on-people-with-disabilities.pdf|https://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/documents/cfpb_ymyg_focus-on-people-with-disabilities.pdf|MODULE 2: .  Saving|"All of these choices are complicated and you may need more information after using this introductory summary. ABLE Accounts ABLE Accounts are an important new resource for people with disabilities. With the passage of the Stephen Beck Jr. Achieving a Better Life Experience Act of 2014, ABLE Accounts have become a new way people with disabilities can save. Savings in ABLE Accounts does not affect eligibility for: Supplemental Security Income (SSI).6; Medicaid and other federal means-tested benefits. ABLE Accounts are set up by or for people with disabilities. With an ABLE Account, the ""designated beneficiary"" is the account owner. Anyone can contribute to an Account for a single tax year is subject to the IRS gift tax exclusions, which is $15, for 2018. Contributions are not federally tax deductible. Some states may allow for state income tax deductions for contributions made to an ABLE Account. However, distributions to the designated beneficiary generally aren't taxed as long as the funds are used for qualified disability expenses."

Saving|ABLE Account programs are established and maintained by individual states. An eligible person can open an account in their own state, if one exists, or in any state program that accepts out of state residents. The maximum allowable value of an ABLE Account in a given state is based on the 529 plan limits established by that state. A 529 is an educational savings plan designed to help families' set-aside money for future college costs. Many states have set this limit at more than $300, per plan.

Saving|Only money in an ABLE Account exceeding $100,000, plus any distributions toward qualified housing expenses and non-qualified disability expenses retained beyond the month of distribution, may be counted as a resource for SSI. If money in an ABLE Account that exceeds $100, causes the person's countable resources to exceed the $2, SSI resource limit, SSI payments may be suspended but not terminated. Benefits will resume when the person's countable resources go below $2,000. Funds in an ABLE Account will be disregarded for purposes of determining eligibility to receive, or the amount of, Medicaid and other federal benefits. Social Security Disability Insurance does not have asset limits and is thus not affected by an ABLE Account. See, Tax Increase Prevention Act of 2014, Pub. L. No. 113-295, 128 Stat. 4010, 4063 (codified at 26 U. S.C.  Note).

These may include: Education; Housing Transportation; Employment training and support Assistive technology; Personal support services Health care expenses; Financial management and administrative services and other expenses that help. to improve health, independence, or quality of life. When savings from an ABLE Account are used for something that is not a qualified disability expense, a portion of the withdrawal that is attributable to earnings will be treated as income for tax purposes. It will be taxed at the person's tax rate, and will be subject to a 10% federal tax penalty as well as applicable state taxes.

Plan to Achieve Self-Support (PASS) A PASS is for people who are already receiving SSI or would be eligible by having a PASS, and want to save for a work-related goal. The objective of the PASS is to help people with disabilities find employment that reduces or eliminates SSI or SSDI benefits. Ordinarily, monthly benefits would be reduced if the person were to increase their income. However, with a PASS, a person can set aside money for work goals that could involve starting a business, going to school, or getting training for a job. Other potentially eligible uses for PASS funds include: Transportation to and from work Tuition, books, fees, and supplies needed for school or training; Child care Attendant care; Employment services, such as job coaching and resume writing Assistive technology used for employment-related purposes; Supplies to start a business Equipment and tools to do the job; Uniforms, special clothing, and safety equipment The person's work goals must include earning income that will partially or completely reduce their SSI benefits. That's the ""self-support"" part. They can also be currently employed and use a PASS to reduce or end their dependence on disability benefits. If the plan is for self-employment, meaning starting a business, the person must create a detailed business plan as part of PASS. The vocational goals must be ""reasonable,"" given any disability-related limitations. This will be determined during the application process.

The following list is from Money Smart for Older Adults. See files. consumerfinance. gov/f/ A freeze on your credit report generally helps prevent new credit accounts from being opened in your name. Usually, third-party-access to your credit file is completely blocked from new users without your express authorization.

Protecting your Money|A freeze helps prevent identity thieves from opening fraudulent accounts in your name. This also means you won't be able to apply for credit as easily if you were planning to open a new account or apply for a loan. You must contact each of the credit reporting companies to freeze your credit report. You will have to contact them to lift the freeze before a third-party can access your credit report. An initial fraud alert requires creditors to verify your identity before opening a new account, issuing an additional card, or increasing the credit limit on an existing account. This is a good first step if you're worried that your identity may be stolen, like after a data breach. The alert lasts for one year and can be renewed after it expires.

At a glance This module can help you think about and plan for savings to help you reach your goals. Saving at tax time. Overview Savings is money you set aside today to use in the future. It could be for something you need in the next few months or even years from now. People save for many reasons: Unexpected expenses and emergencies A bill they know will be due every few months, like car insurance; Annual expenses like children's school supplies To pay for future purchases or life events, like a new TV, appliances, assistive devices, a car, a home, or retirement.

Saving|Focus on Reentry If you are transitioning from incarceration and without a job, saving may not be your first priority.  If you can include savings among your goals, identifying easy ways to save even very small amounts is worth it. Saving money is particularly important if your income fluctuates or varies from week to week. This could be because your income changes depending on how many hours you are scheduled to work each week. It could also be because you work seasonally, rather than year-round. In both situations, setting aside money in weeks or months with higher income can help you pay your bills on time when your income decreases or stops.

Saving|"Some things you can think about saving for include: Saving for your immediate needs such as a security deposit for an apartment, and basic expenses like transportation, food and housing.  If you have any criminal debt, you may want to prioritize saving to pay that debt because it may prevent you from getting a license or place you at risk of violating parole or probation. If you receive benefits payments, you may face restrictions that limit options for saving money. Because savings are an asset, there may be ""asset limits"" associated with the public benefits you receive. Review the Asset limit tool to see if your benefits are affected. If you are disabled, there are savings options that do not impact the asset limits associated with SSI, Medicaid, or other benefits.

Ways to save throughout the tax process. If you need assistance in preparing and filing your returns one of your choices is to visit a Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) site. IRS-certified volunteers can help you file your taxes and make a plan for your refund, all for free. Eliminating preparation fees can make a big difference in your ability to start or build your savings, or pay bills and expenses. Find a site by visiting https://www. irs. gov/individuals/free-tax-return-preparation-for-qualifying-taxpayers or call (800) 906-9887. If you use a paid preparer to do your taxes, they may offer you a refund anticipation check.

Saving|Assets are things you own that have value. Your money in a savings or checking account is an asset. A car, home, business inventory, and land are also assets. Each program has different rules about what counts as an asset and the total value of your assets allowed to qualify for assistance. For some programs, these rules are the same regardless of where you live. For others, each state determines its own rules. In general, your liquid assets (like cash or money in savings or checking accounts) are counted as assets. In some states, if the value of your car exceeds a certain amount, anything over that amount may be counted as an asset as well.

These tribal sources of income may present both opportunities and challenges when planning for the use of income. For example, regular per capita payments may be an advantage to someone whose other income is seasonal or irregular (does not come in at a predictable time or in a predictable amount). Planning with irregular or annual per capita payments may be harder. But without a plan, individuals may miss the chance to build and grow family and community resources for the future. A plan can help someone use their irregular or annual per capita payments to pay down debt, save for emergencies, help family members, or save for the months when there is little or no income. All of these activities build family and community wealth and security. these funds can also be used to invest in assets that can help create financial security and wealth, such as reliable transportation, additional education or training, tools to engage in traditional livelihoods, or business enterprises.

The challenge of managing spending Having control over day-to-day, month-to-month finances is one of the four elements of financial well-being. Many financial education programs teach consumers to create and follow budgets, and getting spending under control can be the first step on a path to accomplishing longer-term financial goals. However, as financial educators know, making day-to-day decisions on spending money is one of the biggest challenges consumers face in keeping their financial lives in order.

Managing cash flow and bill payments When money is tight, consumers often pay bills in a way that makes the problem worse, with late fees, penalties, and higher interest rates. Consumers typically receive about seven to 10 bills a month for regular expenses. They arrive on different days, in amounts that change from month to month. Then, more bills can come up for doctor's visits, home or car repairs, and more. Bills and reminders arrive by mail, e-mail, and telephone. Consumers pay bills in many ways: cash, check, money order, telephone, online, at ATMs, by cell phone, and automatically. The new ways aren't replacing the old ways, so choices and complexity are growing. Consumers may find it hard to keep track of managing all of these financial tasks.

Consumers may get distracted or delayed by small hassles. Shortcuts don't always help; Juggling bills is difficult, so consumers tend to use simple shortcuts. They might pay the smallest bills first, even if they're not the most important. Or they might make partial payments on all bills, even though a partial mortgage payment counts as a missed payment.
